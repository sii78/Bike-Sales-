# Bike-Sales
# Abstract:
This data contains bicycle sales in Europe and the relationship between leading profits with the age groups of the people and according to male and female and the needs that can be purchased when buying a bicycle and we can predict using machine learning future prices once the product is placed and therefore the machine will make the decision in setting the price.
# Design: 
This data was analyzed by reviewing bicycle data in Europe and extracting insights into sales in each of their countries.  And calculate the percentage of profits in each of the European countries. And how much will the profits be in the next five years?  Also, who buys bikes more, males or females, and what are the most expensive types of bikes, who the most years in which bikes were sold?
The results were presented in graphic images that easily simulate this information.
# Data:
In this dataset 113018 rows and 18 columns and main column is sales, in this column Sales According to male and female or Products and number of each product and its sales.
Algorithms:
•	Importing the data and then reading it to know the number of rows and columns.etc
  It does not contain null values
  Duplicate values have been eliminated
•	All questions answered in graphs
Determine of product category in each country
Determine the most types of bikes to buy. Road bikes It is the most purchased by males and females
 Determine the number of the age group most interested in bicycles: 35-64 are the most interested.
•	Converting data from object to numbers
•	The data has been divided to create a new model that predicts profits
•	We used 3 types of models and the best result is Polynomial Regression degree = 4
